create python file and target file under /home/PingMaker/
Give chmod 777 to PingMaker.py??? Forget if needed
Create service file in "/etc/systemd/system/PingMaker.service‚Äù
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable PingMaker
sudo systemctl start PingMaker

Make your targets like this:
10.10.10.10
11.11.11.11

Or like this:
192.168.1.0/24


### ooh an idea is to do an ExecStopPost= in the service file in order to run a cleanup script and erase any empty csvs, as well as compile all of them into a single excel spreadsheet with a sheet per ip
