create python file and target file under /home/PingMaker/
Give chmod 777 to PingMaker.py??? Forget if needed
Create service file in "/etc/systemd/system/PingMaker.service‚Äù
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable PingMaker
sudo systemctl start PingMaker

What this does NOT do yet.
- check to see if address in target list is valid in any way
- handle failures to ping due to bad target
